# Fungal_Networks

Here I will update the multivariate analysis of Network data. To run what I do, you can either clone the repo (downloading it) or you can simply copy the code in the file "Protocol_multivariate.R" and paste it into your own r script in r studio. It is full of comments (which start with #) to help. 

The analysis right now is based on the "edge" data obtained from the NetworkExtraction App of Mark. 

If it is too confusing, I also created this tutorial:
