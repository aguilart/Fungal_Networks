# Fungal_Networks

Here I will update the multivariate analysis of Network data.

To run the analysis (like the pca). You can either clone the repo (downloading it) or you can simply have a "copy-paste" approach: copy the code in the file "Protocol_multivariate.R" and paste it into your own r script in r studio. It is full of comments (which always start with #) to help. You also need to download the data (well my data if you want to do exaclty my analysis). This data is in the folder "processedData" which contains all .csv files that corresponds to the "edge" sheet from the output of MarkÂ´s results.

Thus, this analysis right now is based on the "edge" data obtained from the NetworkExtraction App of Mark. 

If it is too confusing, I also created this tutorial:
